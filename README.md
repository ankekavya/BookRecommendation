# BookRecommendation
📚 Book Recommendation System
🔍 Overview
This project is a Content-Based Book Recommendation System built using Streamlit. It uses TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity on book descriptions to recommend similar books. Additionally, it features:

📖 Google Books API integration for cover images

🌗 Dark/Light theme toggle

💡 A user-friendly Python-powered interface without needing HTML/CSS

🧠 Features
Feature	Description
🔍 Book Selection	Select a book from a dropdown to get similar recommendations
🤖 Content-Based ML	Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to compute recommendations
🖼️ Book Cover Images	Integrates with Google Books API to fetch cover images
🌗 Dark/Light Mode	Toggle between dark and light UI themes (Streamlit-based)
⚡ Fast UI	Built using Streamlit for quick interaction and no frontend coding

🗂️ Dataset
The dataset file book.csv must contain the following columns:

Column Name	Description
title	Book title
authors	Book author(s)
description	Short book summary (used for ML)

You can use a sample dataset or real-world data (e.g., from Goodbooks-10k).

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Install dependencies
Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed. Then install packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn requests
2. Run the App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Then visit http://localhost:8501 in your browser.

🚀 How It Works
TF-IDF Vectorization: The book descriptions are vectorized using TF-IDF.

Cosine Similarity: Computes similarity between books.

User Input: You choose a book title from a dropdown.

Top 5 Matches: Based on description similarity, it shows 5 similar books.

Cover Images: Uses Google Books API to fetch and display book covers.
